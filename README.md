# Assignment-3-Repository

Summary: For assignment 3, I coded a circular, double linked list under the context of a music player. It contains six functions, a quit function, add song function, display function, play current song function, next song function and previous song function. I coded the functions and listed them at the beginning of the code in order to not need prototypes and for easier debugging ( I also just like to keep the function seperate from the int main portion. ). I then printed our the functions as options (0-5) for the user to pick with their input. Then there is a switch statement that takes that user input and makes the decision for which piece of code to run according to the input.
